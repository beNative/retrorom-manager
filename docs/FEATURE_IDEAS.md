# Feature Ideas

Here are some potential features to enhance RetroRom Manager:

## 1. Advanced Media Scraper
- **Description**: Integrate with ScreenScraper.fr or TheGamesDB API to automatically download high-quality box art, screenshots, and videos for ROMs.
- **Benefit**: Automates the beautification of the collection without manual file management.

## 2. Duplicate ROM Finder
- **Description**: Identify and suggest removal of duplicate ROMs (e.g., different regions or versions of the same game).
- **Benefit**: Saves disk space and cleans up the gamelist.

## 3. Save Game Manager
- **Description**: Backup and restore save files (`.srm`, `.state`) to a cloud provider (Google Drive, Dropbox) or a local backup folder.

## 4. BIOS Checker
- **Description**: Verify if the required BIOS files for each system are present and have the correct checksums (MD5/SHA1).
- **Benefit**: Ensures emulators run correctly and prevents "missing BIOS" errors.

## 5. Custom Collections Creator
- **Description**: Create custom collections (e.g., "Mario Games", "Best RPGs") and generate the corresponding `custom-collections` configuration for EmulationStation.
- **Benefit**: Better organization and easier access to favorite games.

## 6. Bulk Renamer
- **Description**: Rename ROM files based on a standard naming convention (e.g., No-Intro) using a database lookup.

## 7. Disk Space Visualizer
- **Description**: A visual chart (pie/bar) showing which systems or games are taking up the most space.
- **Benefit**: Helps manage storage on limited SD cards.

## 8. Theme Downloader
- **Description**: Browse and download EmulationStation themes directly from the app.
- **Benefit**: Easy customization of the EmulationStation interface.
